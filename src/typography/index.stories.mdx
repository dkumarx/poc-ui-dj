# Typography

POC UI Core typography is based on the [Mulish](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish)
font. To set up typography in your application:

- Import the `createTheme` function and use it to create a `Theme` instance.  
  Internally, POC UI Core uses a [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org) NPM package
  to source the Mulish font. Importing `createTheme` will cause the stylesheet
  provided by this package to be imported, loading the font.
- Set up an MUI `ThemeProvider` with a nested `CssBaseline` component.  
  As well as applying the MUI 5 CSS baseline styles, the `CssBaseline` component
  will also ensure that POC UI Core typography conventions are applied to the 
  native `<h1 />`, `<h2 />`, `<h3 />`, `<h4 />`, and`<p />` elements. Nesting
  it within `ThemeProvider` is important, otherwise it will not pick up
  POC UI Core theme customisations.

```
import { CssBaseline } from '@mui/material';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { createTheme } from 'poc-ui-mat-lib';

const theme = createTheme();

export default App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <CssBaseline />

      {/* Components added here will be will have POC UI Core typography applied */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

### Typography Components

In addition to styling native HTML elements, POC UI Core also provides a number
of convenience components that are thin wrappers around the MUI 5
[`Typography`](https://mui.com/api/typography) component. Unless otherwise noted,
the props for these components are the same as MUI 5 `Typopgraphy`, with `variant`
prop removed. The components are described in the following sections.
