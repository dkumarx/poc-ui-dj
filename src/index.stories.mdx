# Introduction

POC UI Core is a library of reusable components based on MUI 5. The package provides:

- A base MUI theme and typography elements.
- A collection of SVG icons.
- MUI component implementations of common UI primitives.

# Installation

Add the `poc-ui-mat-lib` package and its peer dependencies to your project.

```
yarn add poc-ui-mat-lib
yarn add @emotion/react
yarn add @emotion/styled
yarn add @mui/material
yarn add @mui/icons-material
```

# Getting Started

To add POC UI Core to your application, you will need to perform the following
steps:

- Call the `createTheme` function to get a theme instance.  

  The `createTheme` function accepts an optional set of MUI theme options, allowing
  you to further customise the POC UI Core default theme as per the needs of your
  application.


- Set up an MUI `ThemeProvider`, passing your theme as a prop.


- Within the `ThemeProvider`, add an MUI `CssBaseline` component.  

  As well as applying the MUI CSS baseline, thi will ensure that the POC UI
  typography is applied to native HTML elements.


- If you are migrating your application from MUI 4, you can wrap the `ThemeProvider`
  in a `StyledEngineProvider` so as to control the order in which CSS generated by
  legacy JSS stylesheets is injected. For more information on migrating from MUI 4,
  refer to the [MUI 4 migration guide](https://mui.com/guides/migration-v4/).

Once done, any POC UI Core components used within the `ThemeProvider` will be
styled appropriately.

The following code snippet demonstrates the points above, including the `StyledEngineProvider`
recommended for an application that has migrated from MUI 4. 

```
import { CssBaseline, StyledEngineProvider } from '@mui/material';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { createTheme } from 'poc-ui-mat-lib';

const theme = createTheme();

export default App = () => {
  return (
    <StyledEngineProvider injectFirst>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <CssBaseline />

        {/* Components added here will be themed */}
      </ThemeProvider>
    </StyledEngineProvider>
  );
};
```
